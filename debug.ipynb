      "Transcript: So , I understand you've been experiencing some abdominal pain ?  A stomach hurt . It started hurting more the last couple of days , maybe three days ago\n",
      "Transcript:  So , for the last three days , you said it's been hurting more .  Um-hum .  Did you have pain before that ?  Um-hum . It felt weird , like , crampy , but I thought I was constipated , because I haven't been able to go to the bathroom as well .  Hum .  I just , I was kind of bloated a bit , but , yeah , about , about that time , it started to feel a little bit more painful .  Okay . Um , can you tell me where you're feeling the pain the most , ?  Yeah , kind of near my right hip , lower , where my stomach is , right and below my bellybutton . Sometimes , a little bit on the top , just below my belly button , but mainly , just not right lower side , yeah .  Okay . Have you ever had pain like this in the past\n",
      "Transcript:  ?  No . Never\n",
      "Transcript:  And for the last three days , has it been constant ? Has it been on and off ?  I feel it's been getting worse , to be honest .  Okay\n",
      "Transcript:  .  You had , uh , nausea associated with this then ? Okay . Um , did the pain stay in that same spot , or did it just move anywhere else ?  It's pretty much stayed in that one spot . Yeah .  Have you noticed any fevers lately ? \n",
      "Transcript:  So it's a bit hot the other day . It didn't take it to temperature , though .  Okay .\n",
      "Transcript:  And what specifically , uh , prompted you to come in today for the emergency department ?  I thought it was just going to get better when it first started , but here we are , kind of , Thursday now , and it's still pretty bad .  Okay . Have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick lately ? \n",
      "Transcript:  Not off the top of my head , no\n",
      "Transcript:  Uh , and have you traveled anywhere recently ?  No .  And did , uh , you notice any changes to your bowel habits ?  Of course .  Okay .  Uh , before I was fairly regular , about once a day .  Um-hum .  Maybe five days ago I started getting constipated a little bit back up , but then pretty much the picture , I think , last time I went to the bathroom was two days ago .  Because I'm just going to ask you some questions about your overall health . Uh , do you have any chronic conditions that you see your family doctor for ?  .  Or any other doctor ?  No . I got diabetes , type two .  Okay . Uh , okay . What medication are you currently taking ? \n",
      "Transcript:  .  And , uh , have you ever had any surgeries in the past\n",
      "Transcript:  No , I had my teeth pulled as a kid , you know ?  All right . Well , your appendix .  I never had that problem as a kid .  And do you have any allergies ?  Sometimes , get a little bit congested during the fall , but  Okay . Uh , do you have any family history of sphincter intestinal problems ?  No , not that I can think of .  And just in terms of your lifestyle , do you live here in town ?  Yeah , yeah .  You live alone or with family ?  No , I got a family . I need a wife who got two kids , so , yeah .  Nice . Oh , okay . In general , do you drink alcohol\n",
      "Transcript:  Uh , yeah .  Like , small , not regular , special occasions mainly .  Right .  Hot days .  Okay .  Sometimes I'll have a beer or two .  Sure . And do you smoke cigarettes ?  No .  Have you ever smoked in the past ?  No .  Okay . Do you use cannabis ?  No .  Any other substances ?  No .  Okay , well , at this point , I , uh , I will do a quick physical exam , um , we may want to have blood work done maybe some other tests based on what we find out from there . Uh , and then , we can kind of let you know after that , uh , what the next step will be . So , I'm just going to take this and go over it with the physician that I'm working with , and , uh , we'll just talk to you shortly . Thanks for chatting with me .  All right . Thanks , doc .\n"
